# torchdiagram
Pytorch has a compact 'torchsummary' tool for model visualization but merely providing the structural summary info for the model. Motivated by 'torchsummary' tool and the statistical demand of model, a statistical tool called 'torchdiagram' is born to tally the module distribution for the model and visualize it intuitively in the pie style!
